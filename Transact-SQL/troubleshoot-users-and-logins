/*
usually production databases use logins to perform actions sent from the frontend
when updating a database we need to preserve these logins.
when copying a database from development server to production server users can become orphaned.
This is a broad topic i'm just touching on it.

-- we can view the current sysusers on a db:
USE [DB]
SELECT *
FROM sys.sysusers

-- we can view the logins in our MSSQL
SELECT *
FROM sys.sql_logins

-- if a user is in sys.sql_logins and we want to add DBO permission to the login we need to run this code:
USE [DB]
--this creates a user in the database for the login:
CREATE USER [DB_USER] FOR LOGIN [DB_USER]
-- now it should appear in sys.sysusers, we can check.
SELECT *
FROM sys.sysusers
-- now add the DBO role to the user:
EXEC sp_addrolemember N'db_owner', N'USER'

-- Sometimes the opposite happens - there is a user in sys.sysusers but the login disappeared. In this case we run:
alter user DB_USER with login = DB_USER
-- we can check:
SELECT *
FROM sys.sql_logins
